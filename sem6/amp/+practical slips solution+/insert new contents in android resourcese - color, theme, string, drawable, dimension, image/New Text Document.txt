To insert new contents in the Android resources, you need to modify the respective files in the "res" directory of your Android project. Here are the steps to do so:

Color: Open the "colors.xml" file in the "values" directory and add a new color resource. For example, to add a new color named "myColor", add the following line:
xml
<color name="myColor">#FF0000</color>
You can then use this color in your layout XML or code by referencing its name: @color/myColor

Theme: Open the "styles.xml" file in the "values" directory and add a new style resource. For example, to add a new style named "myStyle", add the following lines:
xml
<style name="myStyle" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light">
    <!-- Customize your theme here. -->
</style>
You can then apply this style to your activities or application by setting the android:theme attribute in your manifest or activity XML to @style/myStyle.

String: Open the "strings.xml" file in the "values" directory and add a new string resource. For example, to add a new string named "myString", add the following line:
xml
<string name="myString">Hello World!</string>
You can then use this string in your layout XML or code by referencing its name: @string/myString

Drawable: Open the "drawable" directory and add a new drawable resource file. For example, to add a new drawable named "myDrawable", create a new file called "my_drawable.xml" and add the following lines:
xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:shape="rectangle">
    <solid android:color="@color/myColor" />
    <corners android:radius="8dp" />
</shape>
You can then use this drawable in your layout XML or code by referencing its name: @drawable/myDrawable

Dimension: Open the "dimens.xml" file in the "values" directory and add a new dimension resource. For example, to add a new dimension named "myDimension", add the following line:
xml
<dimen name="myDimension">16dp</dimen>
You can then use this dimension in your layout XML or code by referencing its name: @dimen/myDimension

Image: Add your image file to the "drawable" directory. You can then use this image in your layout XML or code by referencing its file name: @drawable/myImage
After adding these resources, you can use them in your application's layout XML files or in your Kotlin code. For example, to use a color resource in your layout XML, you can use the following code:

xml
<Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:textColor="@color/myColor"
    android:text="@string/myString" />
